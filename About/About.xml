- Adds social impact buff to bigger breasts and penises.
- Removes natural and bionic body part debuffs (not hydraulic/peg as they are supposed to be worse).
- Makes humpshroom less painful to grow and makes it possible to grow it on the ground and in light.
- Removes cum, humpshroom and condoms from default selection for most meals

Thanks to Tory187 and Abraxas for the help in the makings.
Merged XenoMorphie's merge request i missed by a whole year which supposedly fixes errors with socialimpact for archotech bits.
